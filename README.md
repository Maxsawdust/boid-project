# Boids project

This project was made after I watch videos by Sebastian Lague, and The Coding Train, who really put me up to the challenge of making a boid project like this.

## What purpose

This mainly serves as documentation of my understanding of JavaScript and OOP. I hoped that by attempting this, I'd learn a lot about coding and unearth some maths that I may have forgotten from school.

## Next steps

As of writing this, my boid project is largely inefficient, because each boid is iterating over every other boid multiple times.
I intend to come back to this project over time and optimize it as much as possible.
